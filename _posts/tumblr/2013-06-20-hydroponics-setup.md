Hydroponics setup idea.
Made out of simple PVC pipe, the round drain kind you can find in a hardware store. One straight piece and one Tee-shaped piece. Cut some holes for the net pots. A little aquarium pump in the bottom reservoir part. Water tubing from the pump fitted with micro sprays or misters into the long straight part. Everything should be fairly cheap and easy to assemble. Could be made into a big outside model or a little table sized model.
With a distance sensor at the top of the reservoir part to check the water level and a humidity sensor in the horizontal part you could even make it a little smarter and have it refill itself from an external water supply.
Instant flowers and veggies!

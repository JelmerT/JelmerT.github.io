[Hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) setup idea.

Made out of simple PVC pipe, the round drain kind you can find in a hardware store. One straight piece and one Tee-shaped piece. Cut some holes for the [net pots](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-Round-Pots-Heavy-Duty/dp/B001RUJCM4/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1371744029&sr=1-1). A little [aquarium pump](http://www.amazon.com/EcoPlus-185-Submersible-Pump-GPH/dp/B0018WVNXC/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1371744086&sr=1-1) in the bottom reservoir part. Water tubing from the pump fitted with [micro sprays or misters](http://www.ebay.com/itm/15m-50-watering-Misting-irrigation-System-15-nozzle-mist-sprinkler-garden-yard-/290716776496?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item43b011f830) into the long straight part. Everything should be fairly cheap and easy to assemble. Could be made into a big outside model or a little table sized model.

With a distance sensor at the top of the reservoir part to check the water level and a humidity sensor in the horizontal part you could even make it a little smarter and have it refill itself from an external water supply.

Instant flowers and veggies!

This is a quick follow-up post about the [CC2538 development board](http://jelmertiete.com/2014/05/07/cc2538-development-board/) I designed a while ago.

I'm currently focusing on the next version of this board, which will be designed around the more capable CC2650. Therefor I decided to open source the previous CC2538 based design, something I intended to do from the beginning.

I never got around to updating the design to V2 so you can find the design files of the current and only version here: [https://github.com/JelmerT/CC2538-dev-board](https://github.com/JelmerT/CC2538-dev-board). The antenna used on the board has its own repository here: [https://github.com/JelmerT/Eagle-2.4gHz-folded-dipole-pcb-antenna](https://github.com/JelmerT/Eagle-2.4gHz-folded-dipole-pcb-antenna)

If you want more info on the design itself, you can have a look at [my previous post about the dev board](http://jelmertiete.com/2014/05/07/cc2538-development-board/). And if you make any improvements or have questions about the design, contact me or let me know in the comments!
